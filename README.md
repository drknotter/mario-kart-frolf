[Mario Kart Frolf](http://drknotter.github.io/mario-kart-frolf)
================

A small app for adding Mario Kart rules to a game of disc golf.

A group of friends and I like to play this game called [frisbee golf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_golf). We've been playing every Saturday morning for about 5 years now (some of us for even longer). We're also avid videogamers, and most of us can remember spending a lot of our childhoods playing a particular videogame: Mario Kart. Then we got to thinking out loud how funny it would be to add Mario Kart power-ups to our frolf games. Bananas making players throw with their opposite hand. Lightning making everyone throw while standing on one leg. Then we said, "hey, we should actually DO this!" So, I took it upon myself to waste some more time on Mario Kart, and wrote a small app that took care of player scores and assigning power-ups.
