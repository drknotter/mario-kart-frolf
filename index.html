    <center><h1>What the Heck is This?</h1></center>
    A group of friends and I like to play this game called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_golf">frisbee golf</a>. We've been playing every Saturday morning for about 5 years now (some of us for even longer). We're also avid videogamers, and most of us can remember spending a lot of our childhoods playing a particular videogame: Mario Kart. Then we got to thinking out loud how funny it would be to add Mario Kart power-ups to our frolf games. Bananas making players throw with their opposite hand. Lightning making everyone throw while standing  on one leg. Then we said, "hey, we should actually DO this!" So, I took it upon myself to waste some more time on Mario Kart, and wrote a small app that took care of player scores and assigning power-ups.<br/>
    <center><h2><a href="spinner.html">Forget this! Let's play Mario Kart frolf!</a></h2></center><br/>
    <center><h3>Whoa whoa whoa... This isn't 'Nam dude, there are rules!</h3></center>
    Here are the rules to Mario Kart frolf: At the beginning of each hole, each player may choose to get a new power-up by using the handy-dandy spinner app in the  above link. If a player likes what he already has, he can choose to abstain from using the handy-dandy spinner, and keep the power he already has. Other than that, all the normal rules of frolf apply, albeit with a little more mayhem added in.
    <center><h3>But wait, how do I use this thing?</h3></center>
    To use the spinner, first click the "Add Player" button enough times for the number of folks that are playing, and type in each player's name. Click or tap on a person's name to select that person, and then click or tap the big white sqare to spin for a power-up. When scores change, click on the "+" or "-" buttons appropriately, and the app automagically sorts the players into the correct positions. Once a power-up appears in the box, you can look at the rules for that power-up by tapping the "Rules" tab. There's also a combo box at the bottom of the "Rules" tab if you want to examine the rules for a particular power-up.
    <center><h3>Hax! I keep getting bananas!</h3></center>
    Adapting Mario Kart power-ups to frolf is by no means a science. We just sort of made it up as we went. However, if you want to see how power-ups are distributed, I wrote a short document explaining it <a href="probabilities.html">here</a>.
